SQL and Python

**Step1: install necessary dependencies**
- pip3 install mariadb
- pip3 install streamlit

**Step2: create your own dotenv file**
- this should contain your username and password for the mariadb
- if you can't figure out .env file stuff, you can just input your user name and password
  as string in the .py file and comment out the os.getenv stuff 

**Step3: Run the app**
- You are all set, now go to cmd or powershell etc cd into the directory
  in which you downloaded this
- then type streamlit run valentine_gift.py and tada the website will open

**Important Note**
- Although, you may not see database entries on the webpage because your database doesn't have the things I have in mine
- Your best bet would be to **watch the demo video to see how it works or** create a database with the 3 tables I have 
  and populate the tables with the same values, and then run the program
